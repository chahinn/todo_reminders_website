The website is like a simpler version of Asana.com. TextToDo is a simple way to manage tasks among groups.

App that allows users to create lists under which they can add several tasks that relate to that list. 
The creator of the list or (Group) can add people to that list, and be able to see all the taks.
Users inside the list can mark as complete when task is done. 
All users can see the taks completed and the ones that have not been completed.
Users can also send text reminders given a particular taks to members of that list. Thanks to the Twilio API.
