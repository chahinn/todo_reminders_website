All UI Mockups in docs/ui_mockups

1. Create user:
	Actor: User
	Precondition: None
 	Postcondition: USER table is updated with new user information
	Queries: insert into USER (FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password, PhoneNumber) values (‘Edward’, ‘Morse’, ‘asdf’, ‘passasdf123’, ‘2033445678’)

3. Add people to list:

	Precondition: User is logged in and list exists
	Postcondition: SUBSCRIPTION table is updated with new user-list connections
	Queries: insert into SUBSCRIPTION (UserID, ListID) values (15, 21); (will possibly include feature to add friends, in which case we will need a query to select all friends from a friends table and display in a selection menu)

4. Add a task to a list:

	Precondition: User is logged in and assigned to the specific list
	Postcondition: TODOITEMS table is updated with a new task

	Postcondition: Remove all tasks from the TODOITEMS table with associated list, remove all entries in SUBSCRIPTION table with associated list, remove entry from LIST table
	Queries:  delete from SUBSCRIPTION where ListID = arg_list_to_delete; delete from TODOITEMS where ListID = arg_list_to_delete; delete from LIST where ListID = arg_list_to_delete;

7. Modify task:
	Actor: User
	Precondition: User is logged in and assigned to the specific list
	Postcondition: Update relevant entry in TODOITEMS table
